1. Read the section of "Apache Under UNIX" in the text book carefully. Follow the link to setup and configure the apache server. This Apache server will host your future homework. Learn how to upload one web page to the server through FTP.
2. Do some cleaning on the server: remove (rm) the compiled sources that are no longer needed.
3. Read the text book, try to remember all HTML tags that appear. Create HTML pages manually. On your website, I'd like to see:
	1. The homepage of your website, clearly indicating the location of your homework. You will also be asked to place links to all your future homeworks here.
	2. A set of pages comprising the following elements: paragraphs, line breaks, headings, images, hypertext links, hypertext links that target within the same page, an ordered list, a table with rowspan and colspan attributes specified, a frameset which divides the screen into two parts, and an HTML comment.
	3. One photo, which is linked to your personal blog. You can put the photo either on your homepage or on the above-mentioned set of pages.
4. Make sure that your pages can pass XHTML Strict/Frameset validation through the use of the W3C Markup Validator. Minor mistakes are acceptable, although they probably keep you away from A/A+. You can make use of Sogou Browser or proxys to access w3c with an IPGW which can only access CERNET Free IP.
