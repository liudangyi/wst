        <li>What are JavaScript browser sniffers?
          <p>JavaScript browser sniffer is a tool used in websites and web applications in order to determine the web browser a visitor is using, and to serve browser-appropriate content to the visitor.</p>
          <p>It's also used to detect mobile browsers and send them mobile-optimized websites.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Why are they so commonly used in javascripts?
          <p>Because browsers are incompatible with each others due to misinterpretation of HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), or the Document Object Model (DOM). While the World Wide Web Consortium maintains up-to-date central versions of some of the most important Web standards in the form of recommendations, in practice no software developer has designed a browser which adheres exactly to these standards; implementation of other standards and protocols, such as SVG and XMLHttpRequest, varies as well. As a result, different browsers display the same page differently, and so browser sniffing was developed to detect the web browser in order to help ensure consistent display of content. </p>
