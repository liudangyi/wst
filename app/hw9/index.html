        Well, I just want to say that XML is quite a magic thing.

        In web development area, we emphasis a lot on
        seperation of content and style. We've already used HTML to represent content and CSS to represent style.
        It's almost impossible to use no more a useless tag in HTML when creating a real page. But XML does. What's
        better is that it's a built-in feature of all browsers.
      </p>

        Web developer always want to find a way to seperate frontend development and backend development. XML may be
        a consierable solution.
